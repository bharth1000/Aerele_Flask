# Inventory Management System

This project is a simple Python-based Inventory Management System built using Flask and MySQL. It provides a user interface to manage warehouse locations and products, including adding, updating, and deleting product information. The system allows warehouse management personnel to keep track of products, their quantities, and pricing.

## Features

- **Warehouse Locations Management**: Add new warehouse locations with the address and contact details.
- **Product Management**: Add new products to inventory with information such as name, quantity, price, and associated warehouse.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on both warehouse locations and products.
- **User Interface**: Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python, used to create the web application.
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system to store product and warehouse data.
- **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap**: For front-end design and structure.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity, such as confirming deletions and updating products dynamically.
